🎮 How to Use
1. Registration & Login

Create a new account with your email and password
Login to access the detection system

2. Start Detection

Navigate to the detection page
Click "Start Detection" to activate your camera
Allow camera permissions when prompted

3. Perform Signs

Position yourself in front of the camera
Make clear hand gestures for optimal recognition
The system will detect and display recognized signs in real-time

4. Get Translations

Select your preferred language (Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam)
Click "Translate" to convert detected signs
Listen to audio pronunciation of translations

📊 Model Training
To train your own sign language recognition model:

Data Collection

Use MediaPipe to extract hand landmarks
Collect samples for different sign classes
Store as CSV with landmark coordinates


Model Training
pythonfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sign_language_data.csv')
X = df.drop('class', axis=1)
y = df['class']

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Save model
with open('body_language.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)


🚨 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Camera not working?

Ensure camera permissions are granted
Check if another application is using the camera
Try refreshing the page and restarting detection

Model not loading?

Verify body_language.pkl exists in the project root
Check file permissions and model format

Translation not working?

Verify internet connection for Google Translate API
Check if the detected sign text is valid

Performance issues?

Ensure good lighting conditions for camera
Close other resource-intensive applications
Check browser compatibility
